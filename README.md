- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - JWT-based auth with user registration and login
  - Token validation integrated with Swagger UI
- **Entity Framework Core** with automatic migrations at startup
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** enabled for live API exploration
- Deployed to **Azure App Service** with **Azure SQL Database**
- CI/CD via **GitHub Actions** (auto-deploys on push to `main`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8 Web API (Controllers)
- **Database:** Entity Framework Core + SQL Server ‚Üí Azure SQL (cloud)
- **Auth:** JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
- **Cloud:** Azure App Service + Azure SQL Database
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions ‚Üí Azure Web App deploy

## üåê Live Demo
The API is deployed to Azure:  
üëâ [Swagger UI](https://forgetmenot-api-g2bkhhcdedbsgwfe.westus3-01.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Swagger is open for demo purposes. In a production system, access would typically be restricted.
